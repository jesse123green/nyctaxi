Via is considering expanding its service – currently 6:30am to midnight. The main possibilities for expansion are weekends and late nights (midnight to 2am). We are trying to decide between these options and how to launch the option we choose, i.e. launch all at once, or limit to certain areas and/or customers. 

Using the NYC taxi data (described here: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml, available either through BiqQuery https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/imjasonh-storage:nyctaxi.trip_data, or in smaller samples from http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/), how would you answer the following questions:

Analysis questions:
1. Which of the expansion options is most beneficial and why?


2. If we were to launch weekend service, should we alter our hours of operation or keep 6:30am to midnight? Why?


3. Would you launch the expansion in our entire area of service or just for certain areas? If only certain areas, which ones and why?

4. We currently offer a flat fee of $5 per ride anywhere before 9pm, and $7.95 after 9pm. Is this still reasonable for your proposed expansion? If not, how much should we charge? Why?

Qualitative questions – answer these theoretically, no need to implement:

5. What additional data would you like to see in order to answer questions 1-3 more confidently and how would you incorporate it?

6. How might your answer change over time? What Via data would you monitor to ensure the proposed expansion was a good business decision?
